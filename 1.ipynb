    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. It is an indication that something unexpected or erroneous has happened. When an exception occurs, the program raises an exception object, which can be caught and handled to gracefully recover from the error or terminate the program if necessary.\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as invalid input, file not found, network errors, division by zero, etc. Python provides a mechanism to handle exceptions using try-except blocks."
