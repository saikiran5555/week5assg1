    "Custom exceptions in Python allow you to define your own exception classes to represent specific types of errors or exceptional situations that are relevant to your application. They can provide more meaningful and descriptive error messages, encapsulate additional data or behavior, and allow you to handle specific exceptions in a more targeted manner. Let's look at an example to understand the need for custom exceptions:"
